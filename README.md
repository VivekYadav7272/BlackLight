An offline version of WhatsApp, or, specifically a chatroom.

This is an Alpha version and hence is bound to have bugs. I'm currently working on an improved one at this instant.

The communicating devices should have Python compiler on them.

All of them should be connected through a common link, i.e, router, personal hotspot, etc.

[BIG FAULT IN APP]: "server.py" and "client.py" need to be tailored according to which computer "server.py", is hosted on.

                    IP Address for the connection between client and server is needed to be modded accordingly.

"server.py" needs to be run on one of the machines, and before running "client.py" on any of them.

Then, all machines can run "client.py".
"getch.py" needs to be on all machines and in the folder client.py is present in

Rest is self-explanatory within the application itself.

Already existing features:
• Using '@' before typing in a message and followed (without spaces) by the username of another user, you can privately send a message to that user,
  privately. Unlike normal messages which get delivered to all.

Added features:
• Minor bug fixes, I'm still working on this.
